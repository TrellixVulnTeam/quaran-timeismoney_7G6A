A web-scraping bot to collect stock data on companies represented in my portfolio and eventually generate reports and advice. 

Current objective: scrape historical data for largest canadian stocks and compute a loooottt of RMSE's between normalized 
historical data to create equivalence classes for diversification purposes. 

I'm kinda too lazy to make a config file for mail info, the path to the chromedriver, etc. so pleeeassse fill it in yourself.
