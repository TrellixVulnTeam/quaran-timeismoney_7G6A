A web-scraping bot to collect stock data on companies represented in my portfolio and eventually generate reports and advice. 

Current objective: scrape historical data for largest canadian stocks and compute a loooottt of RMSE's between normalized 
historical data to create equivalence classes for diversification purposes. 

The "windowsDynamics2" branch is hectic at the moment, so if you somehow find this repo and attempt to use it in the one day period between now and tomorrow night when I should be done fixing the branch -- watch out.
